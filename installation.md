nginx can be installed differently, depending on the operating system.

#### Installation on Linux

For Linux, nginx packages from nginx.org can be used.

#### Installation on FreeBSD

On FreeBSD, nginx can be installed either from the packages or through the ports system. The ports system provides greater flexibility, allowing selection among a wide range of options. The port will compile nginx with the specified options and install it.

#### Building from Sources

If some special functionality is required, not available with packages and ports, nginx can also be compiled from source files. While more flexible, this approach may be complex for a beginner.

# Examples

#### Installation on Ubuntu 16.04

Nginx is available in Ubuntu's default repositories, so the installation is rather straight forward.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx

```
